LEARN/400 Page Programming Guide

To start LEARN/400, compile the following from source in this order:
QDDSSRC/LRN400STR
QSDASRC/LRN400SCR
QRPGLESRC/ADMLRN400
QRPGLESRC/LRN400

In Beta 1/2, once all files are compiled, you will then need to STRDFU and
create a data file utility for use with LRN400STR. Use your DFU program to
add dummy data to the file and save; LRN400 does not handle empty PFs gracefully
yet. 

Once you have created your dummy content, you can exit your DFU tool. Now you
must determine if you will be the sole LEARN/400 user, if you will be using
LRN400AUT (teletext-style autoscroller), and if you will be offering LEARN/400
to multiple users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are creating a tour file for a single exhibit or you do not wish to use
LRN400AUT, you can simply use ADMLRN400 to edit your tour as you wish. 
If you will be using LRN400AUT or are configuring multiple users for LEARN/400, 
you will need to make duplicates of the LRN400STR file. Make sure to set "Copy
Data" to *YES or else you will need to run your DFU file again on the copied file.

If making a copy for LRN400AUT use, you must name the copied file LRNAUTSTR.
If making a copy for multiple exhibitors, the copied filename must match the
USRPRF name for the other exhibitors.

You will then need to OVRDBF LRN400STR to your copied file. Make sure to
DLTOVR when you are finished editing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you will be using LRN400AUT, you must compile the following files in this order:
QSDASRC/LRNAUTO
QRPGLESRC/LRN400AUT

When compiling QSDASRC/LRNAUTO, you must also specify the WAITRCD parameter.
The WAITRCD parameter specifies in seconds how long to delay before moving onto
the next LEARN/400 screen. This delay is entirely up to your personal preference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are setting up LEARN/400 for multiple users, you will also need to compile
the file QCLSRC/LRN400STUB as the Exhibitor Menu does a direct CALL LRN400STUB
in order to set the correct environment for the LEARN/400 user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have determined how you will be using LEARN/400 for your environment,
you can start the editor by running

CALL ADMLRN400

at the OS/400 command line. The editor is effectively WYSIWYG, where the main ~1,000 character
screen can be laid out however you wish (barring reserved characters in OS/400 DBs), but
there are some special considerations.

For maximum compatibility, you will want to keep your page conetnt confined to the
boundaries of the top and bottom separator lines. You can go over, but the page may shift
and give you undesirable results or be cut off when using some VGA logic modules with LCD
monitors and projectors.

To create a new, blank page, press F5 to go forward. This will create a new empty page.
To go back a page, press F8.
To save a page, press F10. LEARN/400 currently does NOT support unsaved data warnings,
so be careful when navigating to other pages after making edits.

When erasing existing content, it is recommended to type over the old content. Using BACKSPACE
causes page content to shift backwards which may cause undesirable results.

LEARN/400 does not currently have a delete page function or an Erase All button. This will
probably be coming in a later release. If you have content that you do not want people to see,
it is recommended to just use the JUMP keyword to jump over the unwanted page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To assist with page automation, the following keywords are reserved by LEARN/400's main data field,
and one optional parameter is allowed in the EXTRA field. The valid keywords are: 

JUMP: Jump to the PAGENBR specified in EXTRA, leading zero required.
CALL: Call the program specified in EXTRA.

Additionally, the main data field can be augmented with the following keywords in EXTRA for
further functionality:

END: Tells LEARN/400 that pressing the Page Forward key should end the program.
(In LRN400AUT, END is used to signal End-of-File and to wrap around to Record 1.)
