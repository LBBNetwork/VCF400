LEARN/400 Page Programming Guide

For the most part, LEARN/400 is a straightforward application. 
You start ADMLRN400 with your SECOFR parameter and you can immediately begin editing
each page of the file. The editor is effectively WYSIWYG, where the main ~1,000 character
screen can be laid out however you wish (barring reserved characters in OS/400 DBs), but
there are some special considerations.

To assist with page automation, the following keywords are reserved by LEARN/400's main data field,
and one optional parameter is allowed in the EXTRA field. The valid keywords are: 

JUMP: Jump to the PAGENBR specified in EXTRA, leading zero required.
CALL: Call the program specified in EXTRA.

Additionally, the main data field can be augmented with the following keywords in EXTRA for
further functionality:

END: Tells LEARN/400 that pressing the Page Forward key should end the program.
